# ü§ñ LLM Model Comparison Chat           ( -> [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](./README-cn.md) )



A one-stop platform for visually comparing the answers and response speed of mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs)!

This project is designed for developers, AI enthusiasts, and product managers who want to evaluate, debug, and select LLMs efficiently. You can ask multiple models (such as Llama3, Qwen, DeepSeek Chat, etc.) the same question in parallel and instantly compare their answers and response times.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Parallel Multi-Model Comparison:** Configure and activate multiple LLMs, send questions to all at once, and see results side by side.
- **Response Time Display:** Each model's answer includes its response time for easy performance evaluation.
- **Conversation History:** Multi-turn conversation support, preserving each question and all model responses.
- **Flexible Model Management:** Add, edit, delete, or import model configurations via the UI (supports JSON batch import).
- **Modern & User-Friendly UI:** Built with React + Ant Design, featuring a clean three-column layout and dark mode support.
- **Security-Oriented:** Sensitive info such as API keys is managed via `.env` and never committed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd server && npm install
   ```
2. **Configure Models**
   - Edit `server/data/modelConfig.json` to add your model API info (see `modelConfig-sample.json` for reference).
   - Add sensitive info to `.env`.
3. **Start Frontend & Backend**
   ```bash
   # Start backend
   cd server && npm start
   # Start frontend
   npm start
   ```
4. **Open in Browser**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üåü Use Cases
- LLM benchmarking and performance comparison
- Prompt engineering and rapid debugging
- AI product evaluation and selection
- Classroom demos and LLM education

---

## üì¶ Repository & Deployment
- Ready for GitHub, with sensitive and dependency files excluded via `.gitignore`
- Recommended: deploy frontend on Vercel, backend on Railway/Render/your server

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
